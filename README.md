# Signatures of criticality in efficient coding networks

This repository gathers code for the paper:

[Signatures of criticality in efficient coding networks, S.Safavi, M Chalk, N. K. Logothetis, and A. Levina. PNAS 2024 (in press)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.14.528465v1.abstract)

Matlab codes provided in the 'visualizations' folder can be used reproduce a subset of figures of the paper.
If any further information, code, simulated data, please feel free to contact [research@shervinsafavi.org](mailto:research@shervinsafavi.org).


## Setup

### Preparing the codes
To use this repository you need a brief setup as explained below.

- Clone/download the content of the repository in your desired location (say, `path/to/your/desired/location`)
- Start Matlab and cd to your chosen location,
```Matlab
cd path/to/your/desired/location
```
- run the ignit file to add the necessary routines to your Matlab path.
```Matlab
run ignit
```

Then individual codes e.g., `fig1.m` can be executed.

### Preparing the `localdata` directory

The accelerate the process a couple MAT files are prepared, and  should be downloaded from *zenodo* link and stored in the following location (`localdata/papers/effCodCriticality`), 
before using the repository.
